## Script to Install Homebrew
this script was taken from original homebrew script, i just edit one part of the script

## Why
original script not detect selected `xcode command line tools` even though it's already installed from xcode (tested in xcode 11.6) so it will download command line tools again. This script will detect if command line tools is selected, but if not selected even though it's already installed it will download again 😅, _maybe_ next time will update to detect installed
